> Matrix Multiplication\
Parallelized Matrix Multiplication using two Map Reduce jobs.\
\
> Finding Frequent Itemsets\
Implemented SON algorithm to find frequent itemsets for the given set of baskets. The locally frequent itemsets are collected using the Apriori algorithm in the first stage of the SON algorithm.The dataset had around a million baskets and each basket containing containing around 20 items.\
\
> Similar Users\
Locally Sensitive Hashing was used to find top 5 similar users based on the fraction of the movies they have watched in common. Jaccard coefficient was used to measure the similarity. Worked with data that had around 30,000 users and 100 movies.\
\
> Collaborative Filtering\
Performed Collaborative Filtering using latent factor modeling on a rating matrix where rows represented users and columns represented movies.\
\
> Document Clustering\
Implemented Hierarchical Clustering from scratch to cluster documents. Bag-of-words dataset used from UCI Machine Learning Repository.\
\
Tools: Apache Spark, Hadoop, Java, Python\
